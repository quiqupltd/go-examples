# Expr

[Expr](https://expr-lang.org/docs/getting-started) is a simple, fast and extensible expression language for Go. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your Go application. Let's delve deeper into its core features:

- Memory safe - Designed to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and memory leaks.
- Type safe - Enforces strict type rules, aligning with Go's type system.
- Terminating - Ensures every expression evaluation cannot loop indefinitely.
- Side effects free - Evaluations won't modify global states or variables.
